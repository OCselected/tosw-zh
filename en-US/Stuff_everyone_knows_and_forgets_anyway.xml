      There is a lot of crowd wisdom at work here.  It's basic
      physics, too -- if you charge ahead and fall on your face, you
      at least made headway.  Like feeling your way around in the
      dark, each touch, bump, and stub of the toe teaches you more
      about the environment.

      When you drive your processes and technology to the brink of
      failure, repeatedly, you get very comfortable somewhere most
      people don't even want to go.  You also get to set a new
      standard for what is comfortable for your community, giving you
      new room to expand even further.

  <title>Use version control for your content as well as code -
  everyone watches the changes</title>
  <!-- Principle -->
  <para>
    Being able to roll back work encourages people to be bold and
    innovative.  One of the currencies of project work is simply
    making a change to a codebase or a document as an explanation
    itself.  Changes are self-evident in the commit itself.  This is
    why all changes must be accompanied with a comment or summary that
    explains the reasons behind the change.
  </para>
  <!-- Implementation -->
  <para>
    Equally important is that all project members watch these changes.
    Responding to the changes on a mailing list, bug report, or wiki
    discussion page keeps the discussion associated with the node of
    origin.

    <title>Choose open tools that can be extended</title>
    <!-- Principle -->
    <para>
      Don't choose tools just because your small team knows them the
      best.  Be careful of choosing something because you are in a
      hurry and need something quickly.
    </para>
    <para>
      When it comes to tools, talk with trusted community leaders
      about what you should use.  Even if you choose something out of
      step with other community members, you will at least know why
      you did and be prepared to mitigate risk.

	With version control under code and content, you can open
	access to more people.  For example, don't require people to
	go through a lengthy process or to "prove" themselves with X
	number of patches.  Give people access to whatever they need
	to make a difference, even if they don't use the access.
      </para>
      <!-- Example -->
      <para>Wikipedia is a prime example here.  They use the power of the community size to police bad content changes, rather than limiting the community size behind rules of what it takes to write content changes.
