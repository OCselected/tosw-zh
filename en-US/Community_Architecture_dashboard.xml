  <title>Community Architecture dashboard</title>
  <para>
    Red Hat's Community Architecture team supports our executive
    leadership team by providing a dashboard-view of community health
    information. The communities on the dashboard list vary depending
    on interest and need. For example, we are not actively watching
    the health of our Linux kernel or GCC contributions. This is
    because those communities are self-sustaining and extremely
    healthy. Instead, the dashboard watches important, struggling, and
    nascent community efforts that either the team or the corporate
    leadership team are interested in tracking.
