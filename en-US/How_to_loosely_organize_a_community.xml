  <title>How to loosely organize a community</title>
  <para>
    This chapter explains the basic structure of a community that is
    succeeding and evolving.
  </para>
  <para>
    We often call this ''community growth'', with the caveat
    that healthy growth is not boundless growth.
  </para>
  <para>
    Control the growth -- you water and feed, but you also prune.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you look at an open source project with a long history, you see
    these guiding principles of how to loosely organize a community.
    Going through the history of the BSD project, you see they
    discovered and iterated through everything from mailing lists to
    open access code repositories.  Their 30+ year lifespan can be
    viewed as a stretched out version and variation of the Fedora
    Project's 15 year lifespan from Red Hat Linux to Fedora Linux.

    <title>Community soil - true-isms to grow with</title>
    <para>
      You have one of two goals in your community building plans.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>You want to create and be central to the success
      of a community effort.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to be a catalyst in a community that
      includes you but is not relying upon your individual or team
      efforts for survival.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      Arguably, the second goal is the preferred goal for any Red Hat
      community activity that leverages community growth to
      continuously increase the value of our investment, while not
      having to increase the actual investment.
    </para>
    <para>
      When we look at the most successful Red Hat products, they come
      from projects where Red Hat's relative investment over time
      remains flat or decreases in comparison to the ongoing value.
      The Linux kernel forms the core of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
      distribution, but Red Hat does not employ the greatest number of
      kernel contributors, just the ones that do the most work that
      matters to Red Hat as well as the kernel community.
    </para>
    <para>
      When we look at Red Hat projects that fail, the early investment
      was high and stayed high throughout the project's lifespan while
      the community continued to never appear.
    </para>
    <para>
      Regardless of which goal you have, the methodology is the same.

	    If you have more unassigned tasks than 40%, take out some

	  When Fedora decided to migrate to MediaWiki, the

	  wrote, "If you need any help, give me a shout."  Turns out
	  he was a minor participant/contributor in Fedora but was
	  passionate about MediaWiki.  Within a few weeks, he was
	  debugging migration scripts, writing how-tos, and leading
	  various Fedora teams in best-practices about using
	  MediaWiki.  After a highly successful migration and
	  subsequent build-out, Ian was named 'Wiki Czar' in January
